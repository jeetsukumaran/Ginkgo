With empty Individuals:

In Species::get_population, when adding individuals to the new populations:
using assign     8.57 sec.
using push_back 14.8 sec
using push_back with reserve  8.62 sec


Using genotype length of 10:
I suspect that when you get to steps that involve looping over individuals, it
	will be more expensive to use a vector rather than an array with a length
	that is known at compile-time.  Right now, they are about the same, but with
	interesting differences in whether the time is user time or system time:

with vector:
		real	0m13.134s
		user	0m10.966s
		sys	0m2.115s
	
with -DSTATIC_GENOTYPE_LENGTH:
	real	0m14.611s
	user	0m1.435s
	sys	0m13.126s
