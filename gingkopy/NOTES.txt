"SyntaxError: invalid syntax" with setuptools Installed scripts
===============================================================

Problem
-------
After installation using "python setup.py install" or "python setup.py develop",
some scripts fail with an "SyntaxError: invalid syntax" error.

E.g.::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/opt/python-2.5.2-universal/bin/sumtrees.py", line 5, in <module>
        pkg_resources.run_script('DendroPy==2.0.0', 'sumtrees.py')
      File "/opt/python-2.5.2-universal/lib/python2.5/site-packages/setuptools-0.6c8-py2.5.egg/pkg_resources.py", line 448, in run_script
      File "/opt/python-2.5.2-universal/lib/python2.5/site-packages/setuptools-0.6c8-py2.5.egg/pkg_resources.py", line 1172, in run_script
      File "/opt/python-2.5.2-universal/lib/python2.5/site-packages/DendroPy-2.0.0-py2.5.egg/EGG-INFO/scripts/sumtrees.py", line 483
        
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax

The scripts work fine when run directly.

Cause
-----
Trailing (or leading) spaces on blank lines at the end of the file. For some 
reason, this confuses setuptools.


Solution
--------
Make sure that apparently blank lines are truly empty: i.e., strip all trailing 
spaces from lines.


Variation and Idiosyncrasies in Files Packaged with setuptools
===============================================================

When running setuptools "python setup.py sdist", there might be some apparent randomness in the files packaged.

1. Delete the automatically-created package egg-info in the root directory::
    
        rm -rf DendroPy.egg-info
    
   to remove file entries from previous configurations.

#. setuptools monitors files tracked by version control systems, such as CVS and     GIT. An optional plug-in adds in files tracked by Git. All of this may or may not be a good thing!

#. The MANIFEST.in file explicitly controls files added to the source distribution package.
